# Miner

## Overview
Miner is a game we designed where user controls a miner to move up down left right to dig through the earth and collect golds. The map of the game is basically a big square which is made of 64 x 64 small squares. Initially those squares are items that are covered with earth. Once the miner digs up the earth, the actual type of items are revealed. If it's a boulder, then miner will be blocked. If it's a gold, then miner can move into the gold and claim the reward. Once the miner has reached to a certain score, then he wins. In the meanwhile, a monster could come and goes after him. And miner should avoid being caught by it.
